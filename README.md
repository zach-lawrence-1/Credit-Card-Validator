# Credit Card Validator
## Description
Uses the mod10/luhn algorithm to detect if an entered credit card number is valid

## Time complexity analysis
void validate() O(1)

void cardBreakup() O(1)
If the length of the card number was allowed to be n bits, then this algorithm would be O(n)

cardCheck() O(1)
If the length of the card number was allowed to be n bits, then this algorithm would be O(n)

cardType() O(1)
